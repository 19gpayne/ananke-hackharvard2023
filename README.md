Ananke revolutionizes the fitness app landscape by valuing individual effort and willpower over absolute achievements. Instead of focusing on miles run or time spent cycling, Ananke rewards your personal progress. Pushing your limits, even by a small margin, is celebrated and encouraged.

Built upon a foundation of data from wearables like FitBit and Apple Watch, Ananke suggests optimal workouts tailored to your unique performance history. Choose from light, medium, or challenging workouts, and watch as your profile flourishes with plants that grow based on your exercise intensity.

Behind the scenes, Ananke harnesses the power of TerraAPI to extract fitness data, which is then processed on a server and analyzed by OdinAI. This AI determines the most suitable workout suggestions, ensuring every workout is a step forward in your fitness journey.

Join Ananke and make the strongest competitor always be yourself.
